## Sample Project 1 (Tic-Tac-Toe)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where two players take turns to play on a 3 by 3 grid.
Players take turns placing their symbols (either X or O) in an empty cell, aiming to be the first to get three in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The game ends when one player manages to get three in a row or when all the cells are filled.

### Step 1: Creating the board
First, the players need a board to play on.

1. Display a text that displays whose turn it is.
2. Create a button layout in a 3 by 3 grid.
3. Create a clear board button that will clean up the board.


### Step 2: Gameplay
We will now move on to the gameplay.

1. Player 1 chooses a cell to place down an O.
2. After the O is placed, disable the button. (you can remove the button completely.)
3. Check for winners or a draw.
4. Player 2 chooses a cell to place down an X.
5. Similarly disable the button after the X is placed.
6. Check for winners or a draw.
7. Repeat steps 1 to 6 until there is a winner or a draw.

### Step 3: Bonus
- Add fireworks images when there is a winner.
- Keep track of the scores for player's 1 and 2.
- Improve the UI of the game board by adding an grid image for the game board.
